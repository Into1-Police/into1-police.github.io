# Who are we

We are a group of people who think truth and facts are deserves to be known.

# Why create this repo

This repo was created due to the malicious attack and report from some members of INTO1 group fans. Reporting is originally created to help build up better idol fandom community. However, some fans are abusing this system to keep people from telling truth and attacking other people who are fans for other members of the same group.  They also leverage this mechanism to avenge posts or people who try to share criticism and speak up facts. There are numerous articles and accounts which try to tell fans the truth were deleted or terminated because of the reports.
We deeply feel this manner is jeopardizing the idol fandom community and want to make positive contribute to a better community.


All materials and posts are collective efforts from many people who wants speak up and tell the truth, all the information we post are try to be as accurate as possible. All information is publicly obtained and some of information is from fans who were previous engaged in those malicious attacks.
