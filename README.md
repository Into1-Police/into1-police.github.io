# Who are we

We are a group of people who think truth and facts deserve to be known.

# Why create this repo

This repo was created due to the malicious attack and report from some members of INTO1 group fans. Reporting is originally created to help build up a better idol fandom community. However, some fans are abusing this system to keep people from telling the truth and attacking other people who are fans of other members of the same group. They also leverage this mechanism to avenge posts or people who try to share criticism and speak up facts. Numerous articles and accounts that try to tell fans the truth were deleted or terminated because of the reports. We deeply feel this manner jeopardizes the idol fandom community and wants to make positive contributions to a better community.
All materials and posts are collective efforts from many people who want to speak up and tell the truth; all the information we post tries to be as accurate as possible. All information is publicly obtained, and some of the information is from fans who were previous engaged in those malicious attacks.
